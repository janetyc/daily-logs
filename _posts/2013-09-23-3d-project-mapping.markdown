In order to submit an extended abstract for interactivity of CHI2014, we started to work on making a video for demostrating eye tracking on real object in office. Today we searched many examples of different styles of cat illustraction and selected some candidates for main character of demo video. I found enormous cute cats in Pinterest. Aftern selecting some candidates, we projected them onto a paper silhouette. The results showed that the simple design is much better than delicate one.

Deadline is approaching, so we need to work very hard two weeks from now. We plan to solve technology stuff in school and solve design stuff at home. Keep fighting!
