After one week vacation, I feel the energy coming into my body. I feel more energetic while I go back to Madeira. Eveything goes well and I'm so glad I can have the chance to get the internship job here. It's almost the end of year. Only two months left in 2013 and there are still many things to do. I think I didn't do well for this year and I should put more effort on my research. I hope I can achieve my goal next year. Go fighting!!!!!!
