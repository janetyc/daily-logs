I have a wonderful day! Today I get up very early for a skype meeting with my advisor. We discuss with our paper and my plan in the next couple of weeks. We have a paper deadline at 9/18. I need to work harder than ever. The conference is the best one in HCI area, so I have to go there next year. After meeting, Cris, Mao and I go to Levada in the morning. We bring some food and water and take a bus to the mountain. 

We spent more than 3 hours to walk along the paths. We discovered a fascinating nature world there. We found beautiful landscapes and breathtaking views. I felt fresh in the enchanted Laurel Forest. It's a remarkable memory. I fell in love with here and pretty enjoyed my life. :)
