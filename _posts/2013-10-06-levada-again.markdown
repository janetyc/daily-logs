Monchu took us to Levada for having a good lunch today. After lunch, we went to the top of the mountain to have a coffee. Then, we went hiking in one of hiking trails. It tooks us around one hour to arrive the destination. We can see the beautiful mountain scenery in the end of trail. On the way back home, I felt motion sickness. We took a rest in an open-air coffee shop beside the ocean. I felt better half hour later and we went home directly.

For dinner, Mao and I went to Bill house for lapas and beer. We ordered one lapas, fresh fries and two beers. They were very delicious and we felt satisfied. It was a very good day. :) I think I can do better work tomorrow.
