Today we go to art shop to buy some tools for oil painting including 3 pens, 3 oil colors, 8 small convas and turpentine. We plan to draw a oil painting as a gift for music gradfather who makes our small guitar. It's first time for Mao to draw a oil painting. He told me that he felt in love with oil painting. :) He did a great job on his first painting. He said I was a good teacher. YA~ :) Hope I can finish my paintings during my stay in Madeira.
