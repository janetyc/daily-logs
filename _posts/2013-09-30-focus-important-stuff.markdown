Time flies like an arrow. The deadline is approacing. >.< Today we worked like a dog, but there were still a lot of stuffs need to do. Monchu told us that we should focus on gazing part instead of no gazing part. It's very good reminder to let us know which part is the most important part. We easily got stuck in the unimportant but interesting stuff. We should step back and think again our goal of project to adjust work schedule every day. Four days left and we should create a simple version with complete scenario. I think that we spent too much time to polish the quality of animation. We should focus the main things and make everything work. Go fighting!!
