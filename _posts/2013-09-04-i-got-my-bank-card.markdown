During this period of time in Madeira, I open a bank account for getting my salary from M-ITI. I've got my card last Saturday, but I went to the bank for activating my card this morning. We met a good bank attendant, he helped us a lot. He was always smiling. :) I asked many things including wire transfer, withdraw and deposit. He was very patient with me and answered my questions carefully. It's so nice to know the person in the country. *^^*
