Today we start to make a film. We setup the enviornment in Monchu's office and borrow a professional DV from Teresa. We record each stage in many times from morning to evening. We felt exhausted when we finished recording at 6:30 p.m. We cannot do anything anymore. >_< We spent all our energy on that work. Two days left, and we still need to make a video, pick up some songs, and write a paper. While eveything is finished, we have to have a big dinner for celebration. I think we do a great job for this project. No matter how good or bad the result will be. We really love the project. :) It makes me learn a lot.
