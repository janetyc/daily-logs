I forwarded the acceptance email to my advisor today. She told me that I need to create a todo list for camera-ready paper. I started to feel busy right now. The camera-ready HCOMP paper deadline is 6 days later. The CHI paper is due in 20 days in 9/18. There are much work needed to be done. For CHI, I started to write something today. I went through Kim's paper again and analyze the structure of his paper. I need to arrange many ideas into clear storyline. I try to list my objective and contribution in the paper. English writing is difficult for me, but I'll try my utmost to finish it. Never give up!
