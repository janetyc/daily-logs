For my research, I ran another experiment for collecting data from find task in Mturk today. In the beginning, I forgot to push template to Heroku and a worker sent an issue mail to notify me. I manually expired all HITs in a short time. After I fixed the issue, I redistribute 45 HITs again. During one day, all HITs are finished by workers. It's a good thing. :) 

For M-ITI project, I'll have a meeting with Monchu about eye-tracking application or shadow stuff. I feel everything is going well.
