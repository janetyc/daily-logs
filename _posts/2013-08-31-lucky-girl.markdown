Today is the end of Augest. It's Saturday, but we still go to school for speedy Internet. Actually, I promised a friend to go with her by foot. She led us the wrong way and we were so tired. When we passed by a store, we decided to ask someone which direction we should go. How lucky we are! We met a kind woman who was willing to take us a ride. At noon, we went to the traditional market to buy some fruits. I bought some interesting fruits that like a kiwi. 

For dinner, we took a bus to a big mall. We ate sushi, noodle, shrimp and dessert at a buffet. All food are delicious. We enjoy it. It's so tired today. There is a skype meeting at 7:30am tomorrow. To get up early, I need to sleep right now. Night~ Zzzzz
