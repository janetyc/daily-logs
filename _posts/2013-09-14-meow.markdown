I've felt a little tired for working so hard every day. It's a mission impossible but I have to conquer it. The deadline is approaching, but I still haven't finished my paper draft. I really feel anxious about everything. The research work never ends unless you give up. Although i think it's a impossible thing, I still believe that I can learn a lot from the process. I will complete it no matter how bad the result is. Therefore, keeping pushing, keeping fighting!!!!
