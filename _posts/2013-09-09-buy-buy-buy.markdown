I bought a lot of clothes today. >//////< I really love the ZARA coat. It's soooooo cute. I also bought some long shirts for keeping warm in coming cold weather. 

In the afternoon, we went to our favorite place with beautiful ocean view. I drank a kiwi Poncha and organized some references for my paper. I created a flow of paper and tried to convince myself that it's valuable in this area. Even if I thought it was not good enough, I still needed to write it down. I believed that a good idea would come up after starting to write something. Because writing can make my mind clear than before.
