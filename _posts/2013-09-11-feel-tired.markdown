I worked very hard today. I spent all my energy to concentrate on my work. I finished a flow-based task which can be ran easily in Mturk. It was very good stuff for running experiments including each micro task, iterative micro task or a workflow containing many different micro tasks. Due to the broken connection in the student residency, I plan to go to school and run experiment tomorrow. I really don't like to postpone my schedule, but I cannot find other solution. >__< I hope that everything would be ok tomorrow. Go fighting!!!! I will catch up my delayed progress. Even though it's a mission impossible, I still want to give it a try. I believe I can do it no matter what the result will be.
