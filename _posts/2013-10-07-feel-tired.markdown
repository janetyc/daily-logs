We have a bad performance today. After the final burst of CHI deadline last week, we are lack of energy now. Monchu have a meeting with us about next deadline this week. >__< I feel that everyone has a bad mental state today, but we still make a conclusion on it. We plan to make a music intrument based on object color and eye gaze. We would set up iPad mini for capturing the image in real time. The user can play music based on real color by eye gaze.

For another good thing, we visit music shop and see our mini guitar. Music grandfather told us that he will update the making process everyday. It sounds really exciting. :) I cannot wait to see it.
