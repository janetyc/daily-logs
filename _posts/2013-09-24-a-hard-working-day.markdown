Due to the tight deadline, we were very hard working today. We finished the scenario of video, sensing area of eye tracking system and the possible deviation value. After plotting all data in the same figure, we found that the eye tracker can accurately collect gaze data around 30 degrees. According to our observation, we draw the sensing area in the desk. We tried to detect different target points inside the sensing area. The results looked very promising. :) We almost achived the goal today. I'm exhausted right now, but I need to finish character design for cat drawing. Hope I can complete all tasks before 0:30 am. Go go go~
