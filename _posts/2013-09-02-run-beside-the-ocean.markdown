When I come to Madeira, I start to run beside the ocean in the early morning. It's a wonderful experience. Listen to the sound of splashing waves. It makes me feel calm and think a lot. After running, I feel energetic and have a power to fight with work at that day. In the evening, I love to find a place where can meet the ocean to enjoy the sea with a cup of espresso. :)

I gradually fall in love with the kind of lifestyle. <3
