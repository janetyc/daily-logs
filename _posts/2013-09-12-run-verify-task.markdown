I'm exhausted and have a prodoctive day. I finally run the third experiment on MTurk. It has been delayed for one week. :-/ Today I got many error messages and tested many stuffs. The terrible thing was organizing the experiment stuff. I need to prepare the input data with ground truth and make sure everything is ok both on sandbox and MTurk. In the evening, I finished my program and pushed my code to remote server. I distributed 45 HITs in MTurk. After 15 minutes, there were 5 workers completed the task. It seems like a good new for me. I hope I can catch up all delayed plans. Go fighting!!!!! Go go go~~~
