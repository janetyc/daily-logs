For our final project in M-ITI, we tried to use Leap Motion to control the flap display as music instrument. Leap Motion is a tiny device which can recognize hand position and gesture by depth camera. We used left hand to control the speed of flip action and right hand to control the number of flap display. For our first protoype, we can act as an director of music band to create an improvising rhythm. We also tried to read a midi file to trigger the flip. It's a very intereting project and we feel so excited about the results. Hope our concert can succeed next Monday. :)
