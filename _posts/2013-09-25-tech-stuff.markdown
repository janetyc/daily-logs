We've reached our original goal today. All technical stuffs including environment setup, board calibration, paper sculpture and object detection were completed as planned. We also collected many testing data from Mao and me to investigate the dependence of the eye tracking gaze data. According to our observation, we found the best sensing area and make a decision about our detecting algorithm. Because of the limited schedule, we prioritized all works and decided to use a naive solution to recognize the correct position of each real objects in the desk. Through getting the position of target obects in the begining, we can easily use the distance to measure whether eyes gazed at the object. Tomorrow we will try to combine project mapping with the real object detection. While the user gaze at the target object, the projector will project some animations or spotlight on the object. In order to eat delicious food this Friday, we'll work very hard in next two days. YA~ we can do it!!! ROCK!!
