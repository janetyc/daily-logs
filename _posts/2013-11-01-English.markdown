In order to write a good paper, I've started my English improvement plan two weeks ago. I choose one article to read aloud and record my voice every day. I also find some grammar article to review basic usage of English. Sometimes I feel bored to do it, but I keep doing it every day. I believe that my English skill can be imporoved during two months. Furthemore, I should add some technical writing practice into my daily learning lession. Go fighting! :)
