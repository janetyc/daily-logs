After working so hard for several consecutive days, I've submitted an 4-page short paper in CHI2014. I ran two experiments but one failed this morning. I felt so depressed and the worst idea ran through my mind. It was an mission impossible, but I really don't want to give up it. When I almost give up the submission, my friend told me that I can submit a short paper with 4 pages. 4 pages!!! I originally thought that I need to write 6 pages for an note paper. In the last 5 remaining hours, I decided to submit a short paper. I quickly finished the paper and submitted it in the website. In the last one hour, I continually revised the paper and updated it at any time. The result must be terrible but I've already tried my best to reach the goal. I've found an interesting stuff from the project during the period of time. I felt different from before. Good job! :) Keep fighting for next couple weeks.
