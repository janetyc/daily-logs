Today is Saturday, but we still went to school for our project. I spent much time to design the characters of our animations. First, I drew many cats with different styles by pencil. Then, I copy all of drawings on tracing paper. Next, I used wacom inkling to redraw them again. Finally, we transferred all digital file we recorded in inkling to my Mac. The working process is like Pixar studio. Haha :)  Hope we can make a super great video and get accepted in Interactivity track.
