I've got my mini guitar today in music shop. The grandfather told us that he put a lot of love in the instrument. My mini guitar is named as Braguinha, a kind of Cavaquinho. The tuning is D-G-B-D. I also got a book of Braguinha from the grandfather. Mao and I sent him a small gift, an oil-painting with guitar and his face. He told us he was so touched to receive the gifts. He put them on the wall and submitted those pictures to Facebook on the spot. The instrument I had is full of memorable stories in Madeira. T^T I have to miss here when I go back to Taiwan.
