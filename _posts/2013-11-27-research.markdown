It is the first time to participate the dynamic meeting when I came back last week. I've heard everyone's sharing and I started to rethink many things about research. I missed the research life in Madeira. I can so focus on one thing. There were so much works, but I felt satisfied with what I've done every day. I think I need to keep my research on track this week. I should clearly define my research goal and make my future plan in the next week.
