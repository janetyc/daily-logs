Due to unpreditable coincidence, I realized that I can't get my passport in time by express delivery yesterday. I was like a cat on a hot tin roof. >_< 

I posted a help message on Facebook, my friends help me broadcast it to their friends of friends. The social network is powerful. I found a friend's friend's friend (three degrees) who can help me bring my passport back to Taiwan today. T^T 

Too many thanks to my lovely friends! How such a lovely world! I really appreciate everyone's help. I must do my best on my research in this opportunity. 

Love you my friends. :-)
