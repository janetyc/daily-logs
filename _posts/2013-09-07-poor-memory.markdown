I did the laundry in the early morning today. When I waited for my cloth, I draw two weird creatures by watercolor. The creatures are the combination of cat and ghost. The drawing contains yellow, red, green and white color. Especially white color, I use it for sharpen the edge of creature. I really love drawing something unusual. It makes me feel relaxing. 

There was an interesting thing happened today. I always thought that today was Sunday. In fact, I make a mistake on it and three friends correct my sentence simultaneously. How poor memory I was! -.-
