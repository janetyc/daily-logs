We've went to the Miro Museum in Barcelona. Miro formed the foundation with his friend. He want to create a new building that would encourage younger artist to experiment wit contemporary art. The collections are from his early age to the final age. We can see many astonishing works in the museum. Today I saw a little boy who drew and mimic the Miro's work. He did a great job on it. He is talent and focus on his drawing. I hope I can have a child like him in the future. :)
