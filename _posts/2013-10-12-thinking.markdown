Some good friends are attending UIST 2013 conference during 10/8~10/11. At the same time, I've reviewed some interesting projects in the website. It's so inspiring. I think deeply about my future plan in my life. What's the most important thing I'd like to do? That's the question I always ask myself since entering the college. I think I should face up my desire and do it right now. I really love to do research and want to create something creative. I'd like to make something to change the world. Therefore, I should spend more time on my research. I should give up bad habit on hanging on Facebook.
