The last day in Eurpean, we stayed in a super great hostel named Desitnation Hostel. It has perfect location, comfortable rooms, and cheaper price. We spent 10 EUR for one night included breakfast. It's super cheap. We had a good experience there. If I have opportunity to visit Lison again, I would certainly live there again. One day left, we'll go home tomorrow. :)
