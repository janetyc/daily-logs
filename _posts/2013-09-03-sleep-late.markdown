We had a dinner and drink with alcohol today. I was a little drunk when I came back in the residency. However, tomorrow is the deadline of CRC in HCOMP13. I need to modify our paper and create a camera-ready copy. I tried the program they provided and got the different results from my friend. I was so confused about it. And then I tried to submit a first version in the submission website. Because of poor Internet connection, I got a notification email from system. It told me that my submission was not completed yet and asked me check all stuffs again. :-( 

Finally, I found a way to add missing files to the website. It's an another method for revised version paper and supplementary files. I follow the instructions they provides in the website. I completed all steps and sent a email for confirmation. Well, finally, everything was done. But, it's 5:30 a.m.!!!!!! >__< Too crazy!
