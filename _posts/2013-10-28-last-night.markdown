Today is the last night in Barcelona. There are many great memories here. One week trip is a little fast but long as well. It's time to go back to work. I need to prepare my poster and slide tomorrow. I'll go to US next Monday. I have no time to waste. Hola Barcelona~ Byebye Barcelona! I'll miss you. I hope I will visit you again in 2026.
