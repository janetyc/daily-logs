Today was the day before my HCOMP trip. We went out to draw landscape using pencil and water color. This is first time I used light color to represent the view. I was satisfied with my first trial and enjoyed in my drawing process. I think I will take a drawing course again when I go back to Taiwan. Drawing makes me happy and relax. It's a goood excercise for releasing my stress.
