I spent many time to check the air ticket of HCOMP conference today. After comparing serveral sites, I finally found the optimal solution but still teriible. ~.~ I should transfer flights by 3 stops. Total time I spent in round-trip transportation is around 50 hours. The waiting time is around 5 and half hours. How terrible it is. I believe that I can learn a lot and meet many great people in this conference.
