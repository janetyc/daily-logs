We've submitted a paper for CHI interactivity today. I feel exhausted but satisfied. I think we did a great job for this submission. I'm very proud of this project. :) After finsihing the submission, Monchu bring us to a delicious restaurant and eat a very great steak. The one month project is the best working experience I've never had. I'm so passion about applying the technology to my own research project. That would be a awesome match. During the submission, I think I make some progress in my English writing skill. Keep doing :)
