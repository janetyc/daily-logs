Nikita is one the the most appreciated drinks in Madeira. It is made of beer, vanilla and small pieces of pineapple. I really love it. Today we had a big meal for dinner. We celebrated three big things. One is for paper submission, another is for Mao's birthday and the other is for the Moon Festival. Today's moon is so big and beautiful. We took many picture for the moon. It was so relaxing. :) To be honest, I love the life in Madeira. It made me feel confortable and energetic. Although I finsihed a deadline yesterday, I need to keep fighting for another one. Keeping pushing! Go~
