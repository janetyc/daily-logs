Today we visited the instrument store again. A guitar player named Martins, who is a friend of instrument grandfather, was in the store. After introducing ourselves, we encouraged him to have a live guitar performance for us. He was a fantasy guitar player and was skillfull with his hands. We were enchanted to the music he played. I really want to learn how to play classical guitar instead of balladry guitar. What a fantastic experience! I'm sure to come the store again and order my hand made classical guitar here. I would bring it back to Taiwan. :-)
