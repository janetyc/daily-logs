I've took the airplane to lisbon already. Now I'm waiting for my next flight to Paris. Everything is ok but feel a little tired. I feel motion sick after 30 mins bus path when I go to the airport. During boarding, a lady told me I cannot bring two hand bags to the airplane and ask me to combine them into one. I told her I cannot do it. She is a nice person. She help me transfer the luggage without any charges, but she told me I need to make it one when I go back to Funchal. I promise her but I'm not sure I can do it. I'll try my best. How lucky I am. :)
