In this morning, Mao and I took a cable car to the mountain. The view from the cable car is even more amazing. We can see the sky, sea and many roofs. When we arrived the destination, we went to an ancient church. It's a sublime and beautiful place. By walking around the church, we met four cute cats and one grandmother. We enjoyed taking photos of those cats. One cat was like professional model and it always make a good pose when we took pictures on it. It's very relaxing day. I really enjoyed it.
