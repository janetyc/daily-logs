Wow, I found that all 45 HITs was done by workers during 5 hours. I distributed all HITs at midnight yesterday, and I got all results when I got up this morning. I took a look at the results. It seems like there are some interesting observation from those results. In order to catch up progress, I put organizing stuff on one side and try to modify find task. It's a coding day. But I had a fever and slept a lot today. :-|
