According to my observation, the Internet speed is fast around 5-8am in the early morning. To access Internet, I decide to get up at 5:30am to do some work. Today is first day to fulfil my promise. I got up at 5:30am successfully, but I went to sleep when I kept awake for one hour. Then I ran at 8:00am and found that I had a period today. I felt a little sick in the morning, but I was a early cat! YA!

After taking a nap, I felt much better than before. We went to McDonald to eat lunch and enjoy the speedy Internet. I can't stay focus on my writing because of noise in the space. I asked Mao to switch to the space where we can see the ocean and there is pretty good Internet connection. So, we have a relax but hard-working weekend. I am behind in my work.:( I should work very hard this week.
