After a long flight journey, I finally go back to my sweet home. My cat go to sit my legs when I go to my room. It seems that she misses me a lot. She always follow me and watch me doing something. Although, there is a bad thing happened today, I still feel happy now. :) Tomorrow I have a meeting with my advisor, I should prepare my slide to show her my further plan on my research. Go fighting!!!!
