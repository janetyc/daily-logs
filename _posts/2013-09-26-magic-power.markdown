We finally made a beta version of physical object detection in office using eye tracking device. The system would know where I'm looking at. Today we'ved tested 3 real object detection and triggered a specific animaiton when the object had been gazed. Scroll webpage application were also controlled by gaze-based interaction. 

Based on our original plan, we still need to finish iPhone application which can receive a OSC message to show or switch wallpaper and play an animation by gazing at iPhone. Everything seems on the right track. Hope we can success at this time. :)
