There is 9 days left to write a paper. It's really a hard job for me. :( But, I still have to conquer it. It's my job. It's the way I choose to live. I really enjoy the life in Madeira. I can focus on my reserach and interesting stuffs without any annoying things. Everyday I only think about research and myself. I regularly run beside the ocean in the early morning. In school, I work for eye tracking stuff; at home, I work for my own research. Even though I am a little busy, I still love this kind of life. I would like to challenge myself. Today was a wonderful day. I met a music grandfather and ate a delicious hamburger. In addition, I finished a new version of verify task. I would test it tomorrow. :) Go fighting!!!!
