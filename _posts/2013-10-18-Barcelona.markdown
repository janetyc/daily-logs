Finally, we've submitted our second paper for TEI art track. I feel relieved when we sent the submission email to conference committee. Today we spend much time to book our air tickets and hostel for Barcelona trip. After calculating multiple comparisons, we found the most cheapest ticket and an fasion style hostel. Thanks for my friend's sight spot recommendation, we have a lot of candidates to go in Barcelona. I cannot wait to go there. :)
