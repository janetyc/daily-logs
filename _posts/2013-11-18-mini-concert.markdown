Today is the last day we stay in Maderia. We have a mini concert in M-ITI to say goodbye to our friends. We'd like to tell everyone our feelings and stories here by music. In the concert, we use, collaborate and control self-flap display to play music. We explore the possiblity of the experimental instrument and demostrate four different ways to play with it. The topic of concert is about encounter. We encounter the funsion here. 

The following is our story during three months.
Three months ago, we walked to the hill of wind. We were confused about life. Why we came here? For what? The question was always come up in our minds anytime. Finally, we found a solution. Here, we encountered many amazing people and made good friends. We encounter the fusion. The fusion of Eastern and Western. The fusion of Analog and Digital. The fusion of Discrete and Continous. The fusion of Love and Dream. We use four songs to show everyone our feelings and stories.

Four Songs
1. Walk
2. The Hill of Wind
3. What for ?
4. Fusion

We did a great job on the concert. It was a perfect ending of the 3-months life. I have a unforgottable memory. I would miss here definitely. T^T
