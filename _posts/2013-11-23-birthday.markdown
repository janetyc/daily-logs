Today was my birthday, but I went to MOCA Taipei to fix our work. We faced a weird issue in iPhone app. Our app crashed while starting up. I could't find any issue, so I decided to reinstall it. Everything wents well after reinstalling. After finishing the task, I went to Taichung by TSR. I lost my ticket in train, so I bought a ticket again. :( Today was not my day, but it was. It was so complicated. Except this, I thought I got many wishes from my friends. I was happy!!!! YA~
