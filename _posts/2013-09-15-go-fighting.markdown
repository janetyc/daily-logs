Only Three days left to do everthings including running second experiment, organizing experiment result and writing paper. I'm anxious about my paper. :'( It's no time to take a break. When I stop writing, I start organizing result and preparing input stuffs for further experiment. After working so many hours today, I cannot think anymore. I really need to sleep and make my brain stop thinking. 

According to the first experiment, I found it interesting that people perform better result on identifying the label of component rather than verifying the correctness of label. It explodes my previous hypothesis. My original thought is that draw task is much harder than find or verify task. However, I got a better result of draw task. I need to make a conclusion about those results. Go fighting!!
