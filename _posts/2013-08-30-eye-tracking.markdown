I am exhausted today. I summarized the reviewers' comments and made a plan for modifying HCOMP camera-ready paper in the morning. And I dig in Tobii eye tracking system and try to set up develop environment in Windows 7. Mao and I spend much time to set up the path including external library and including file. Because of occuring too many errors, we decided to clone the sample code as basic project and modify them to be a solution fits the need. The most interesting thing is that I use my eye to play a shooting game. When I stare at a rock, the aircraft shoot a bomb on it. After playing 2 rounds, I feel tired and cannot open my eye. >__< But, it's a very interesting device. :)

Hard working day. Keep fighting! :)
