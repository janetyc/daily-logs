As the title says, the deadline is postponed. We are so happy to know that in the website. To be honest, we had a poor progress this week. The sound we created by program is not at all satisfying. That's why we are happy to hear about deadline extension of TEI art track paper. That means we have more time to do some fine tuning on our sound design. I have a good chance to learn Pure data for this submission.
