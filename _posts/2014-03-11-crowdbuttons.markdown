To catch up the deadline of HCOMP 2014, I've worked hard in the past one weeks. I did a literature survey, framed my problem, and implemented a prototype. I gave a presentation about my new project in the group meeting. I think I did a good job and got many useful feedbacks. I'll finish all the stuff this week and run a experiment to test my idea in situ. :)
