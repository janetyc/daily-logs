We've visited 3 fantastic buildings designed by Antoni Gaudi: Sagrada Família, Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. I'm not familiar with Gaudi till now. His architecture attracks me a lot. I know him through his building. I think he is a man who has chariness, responsibility, humor and talent. I really like Casa Mila. The statues standing on the top of building is so cute. They are like a human with multiple facial expressions. Tomorrow we will go inside the Sagrada Família to appreciate its beauty.
