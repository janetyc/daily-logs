Monchu has invited us to dinner in his house today. We walked along the ocean and arrived at his hourse in 30 minutes of walking. This is the first time we go to Monchu's house. There is a grand piano in the living room and the music books are close to the piano. Monchu had succeeded in making Korean seafood pancake. The pancake was very delicious. We had a great dinner and felt satisfied. When I return to Taiwan, I would like to try Korean seafood pancake. :)
