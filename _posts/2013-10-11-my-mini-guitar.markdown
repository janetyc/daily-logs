Today we go to visit music grandfather to see our mini guitar. The music grandfather makes progress and submit photos to Facebook every day during this week. We are excited to see the making process of our instrument. The grandfather told that each intrument is unique and personal. We should play it every day and it would repond us by a good sound. If we play it more frequently, the sound of intrument will become better and better. He also told us that we should not lend our intrument to others. One intrument is played by only one person and it will be shaped the special relationship between intrument and player. That is an important lession I've learned from the grandfather. :)
