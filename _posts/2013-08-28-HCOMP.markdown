Today was first working day in Madeira. We had a meeting with Monchu in M-ITI. We discussed some ideas about eye-tracking and shadow related application. First, we came up three potentional applications including drawing assistant, social game and interative museum. And then we had a heated discussion about novelty and feasibility. In the end, we made an aggreement with 3D eye-tracking stage performance. After discussion, we had a great dinner in a beatuiful place. It's a very good day. :)

Anothre big thing is that I got a notification from HCOMP. My demo paper was accepted!!!!!! :D I'm sooooooo excited. I can go to HCOMP conference and give a demo to present my work. I can meet some good researcher I admired in that conference. I think that would be a perfect experience in my life. I must get many valuable feedbacks from attendance. :D
