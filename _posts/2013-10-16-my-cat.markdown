I miss my cat so much when I heard from my mom about its behavior. She told me that mimi always go to sleep with her every day. It seems to become a small kitty and always purrs at night. I really want to hug my cat and tell it I love you. One month left in my internship, I'll go back to Taiwan to continue my research. I hope I can do best this year. Go fighting!!!
