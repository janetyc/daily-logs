We've visited the Picasso Museum today. The museum has the most complete collection of works including his first major works, The First Communion, and Science and Charity. For blue peroid, he used blue color as his major color and every paintins in this perioid are full of sadness. For his late peroid, he use abtract expression in his paintings. I really love his late work that is full of imagery. I mimic some drawings on my sketch book. Those drawings will give me many inspirations while I create my own work.
