Today we go to Sagrada Familia again and visit insdie the church. We enter it directly because of online reservation. I'm astonished by the building. Gaudi applies numerous organic elements and geometric shape into the structure. We can see both nature and artifical beauty in one architectue. There is another exhibition took place in the church. It introduces the detailed design concept of the Sagrada Familia and demostrates many amazing models. We can understand the design of architecture through those documents. It's really good experience to see the building. I believe that I will come back to see it when finished.
