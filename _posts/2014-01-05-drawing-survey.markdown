Eitz et al. create a large scale database of human sketches. They performed a study to know how well humans can identify the sketches correctly and compare it with a computational method. Based on the computational model, they demonstrated an interactive sketch recognition system. In the end, they released the complete crowd-sourced database of sketches to the community.
