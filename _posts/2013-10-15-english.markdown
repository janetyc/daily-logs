To improve my English, I start to write an English diary since I came to Maderia. I strongly feel that I can write it more smoothly than before. Now, I start to practice my English speaking every day. I choose one article and read aloud it. I record my speaking using an iPad app and listen it after recording. I'll keep on doing it from now on. Next, I'll try to write a short critique for each paper I read. I hope I can improve my English skill as well as my research skill several months later. :)
